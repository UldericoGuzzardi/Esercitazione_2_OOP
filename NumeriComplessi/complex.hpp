/* Templates: recall that where you see `template<typename T>` you should

 * C++20 introduces a feature called "concepts", which in some way allows

 *
 *      template<typename T> requires std::integral<T>
 *
 * you should read it as
 *
 *      for all T   such that   std::integral<T> is true
 *
 * In addition, std::integral<T> is true if and only if the type T is some
 * kind of integer (short, int, long...)
